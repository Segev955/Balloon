# Balloon Experiment

This repository contains the code for the Balloon Experiment conducted by students at Ariel University. The experiment involved using the LORA device and the Mashtastic application to send messages to an Android device attached to a balloon. The Android device was equipped with a custom application that we developed specifically for this experiment.

## Experiment Description

The goal of the experiment was to test the functionality of the LORA device and the Mashtastic application in transmitting messages to the Android device on the balloon. We wanted to explore the capabilities of the application in capturing and storing media (photos and videos) received from the Mashtastic messages.

The experiment involved the following steps:
1. Setting up the LORA device and connecting it to the Mashtastic application.
2. Attaching an Android device with the custom application to a balloon.
3. Sending messages from the Mashtastic application to the Android device using the LORA device.
4. Testing the functionality of the custom application in capturing and storing media based on the received messages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- `app`: This directory contains the source code for the custom Android application.
- `screenshots`: This directory contains screenshots of the application in action.
- `videos`: This directory contains video recordings captured by the application.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for this repository.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the experiment and the application.

## Getting Started

To replicate or further develop the experiment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/Segev955/Balloon.git

2. Open the `app` directory in Android Studio or your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).

3. Build and run the application on an Android device with the required permissions and hardware capabilities.

4. Install the Mashtastic application on another device and set up the LORA device for communication.

5. Send messages using the Mashtastic application and observe the custom application's behavior in capturing and storing media.
